              In complex accounting and tax environments, the strongest signal of
              quality is not a slogan—it is the discernment of the people you serve.
              We treat every engagement as a partnership where your standards shape
              our priorities: accuracy you can defend, advice you can act on, and
              outcomes measured in trust as much as in compliance.

            <p className="consulting-section__body consulting-section__body--emphasis reveal reveal-delay-3">
              When clients exercise sharp judgment, they choose partners who respect
              both the letter of the law and the reality of their business—that is
              the bar we hold ourselves to.
